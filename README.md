This project requires Python 3.X (Will not work with Python 2).

First you need to download two libraries for python.

> pip install matplotlib

> pip install networkx

Navigate to the same folder as the python files.  To start the Graph Shell, type:

> python GraphShell.py

There will be further instructions once the shell is loaded.
